## Starting the Application

You need **TWO** terminals for this.

In one terminal, run `bundle` in the root directory of the app to install the dependencies. Run `bin/rake db:setup` to create the databases (called rails_project_development by default). Run `bin/rails s` to run the server.

In the other terminal, `cd` into `client`. Run `npm install`. Then run `npm start` and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

NOTE: You need at least Ruby~ 2.3.7 in order to run bundle. Please update your RVM first!
